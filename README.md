# Design System Project

I started this project to have a place where i can practice, learn and improve my react skills.

This project used [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io) as css framework, basically for the grid system.
All components listed here have their own css, agnostic from Bulma.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Get started

Start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build the app for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```
